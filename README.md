## Overview.

This repository contains a movie-related web application built with React. It features a variety of pages and components for browsing, viewing details, and interacting with movies, including functionality for adding reviews, exploring similar movies, and managing favorites. The app uses data from The Movie Database (TMDB) API to provide information on movies, TV shows, and related media. It also incorporates features such as a custom spinner for loading states and a dynamic movie list display. The project is organized into components, contexts, hooks, and pages to ensure scalability and maintainability.
